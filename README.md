# VISUAL STUDIO CODE CONFIGS
This repo only contains the VSCode extensions and settings I use in my 
personal computer. That way I can sync it to other laptops (especially 
public or school ones) without logging in to github and exposing my 
[password manager](https://bitwarden.com). <br>
At least for now, all it's doing is trying to get as close as possible to my 
[neovim-rc](https://github.com/eduardosaraujo1/neovim-rc) config, containing 
VIM and custom keybinds. <br>
I plan to install [VSCode Harpoon](https://github.com/tobias-z/vscode-harpoon)
in a future update, however I couldn't get it working.

# VSCODE-SETTINGS
This repo holds configuration settings for VSCode, and now Sublime too!

# HOW TO USE
1. Copy the `settings.json` file to the VSCode user settings folder.
The `settings.json` default path is as follows:
    - Windows %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json
    - macOS $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json
    - Linux $HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json
2. Either install extensions manually, or copy `.vscode` to a project and open the folder.
3. Copy sublime settings to `/Packages/User`
The `/Packages/User` location by default is as follows:
    - Windows W.I.P
    - Linux $HOME/.config/sublime-text/Packages/User
    - macOS UNKNOWN

# VSCODE-SETTINGS
This repo holds configuration settings for VSCode, and now Sublime too!

# HOW TO USE
1. Copy the `settings.json` file to the `User` folder
The `settings.json` default path is as follows:
    - Windows `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json`
    - macOS `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json`
    - Linux `$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json`
2. Either install extensions manually, or copy `.vscode` to a project and open the folder.
3. Copy the `Preferences.sublime-settings` file to the `/Packages/User`
The `/Packages/User` default path is as follows:
    - Windows `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages\User`
    - Linux `$HOME/.config/sublime-text/Packages/User`
    - macOS UNKNOWN
4. On sublime, Install Package Control and install the sublime extensions.
